I'm Harshul, a high school student from Ontario, Canada. I'm currently working on helper, a command line app (made with Rust) to help keep track of tests and assignments and homework with everything moving online. I'm currently in the process of learning Rust and C/C++ (as part of the Crafting Interpreters book). To talk to me, feel free to e-mail me anytime.
